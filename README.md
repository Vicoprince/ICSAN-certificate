# ICSAN Certificate Request System

Welcome to the ICSAN Certificate Request System repository! This full-stack information system is designed to streamline the process of certificate requests for students of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators of Nigeria (ICSAN). The system utilizes Node.js, Express.js, EJS templating engine, and MongoDB to provide a secure and efficient platform for students to make requests for certificate collection.

## Features

- **Form Authentication and Authorization:** The system implements robust form authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to the certificate request functionality. Users are required to authenticate themselves before submitting certificate requests, and authorization controls are in place to restrict access based on user roles.

- **Certificate Request Submission:** Students can easily submit certificate requests through the intuitive user interface provided by the system. The submission process is streamlined, allowing users to input necessary details and submit requests efficiently.

- **Database Integration with MongoDB:** MongoDB is used as the database backend to store and manage certificate request data. This ensures data persistence and scalability, allowing the system to handle large volumes of requests effectively.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Node.js and MongoDB if not already installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Install dependencies using the command `npm install`.
5. Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection in the `.env` file.
6. Run the application using the command `npm start`.
7. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, users can access the certificate request functionality by navigating to the appropriate routes. Students are prompted to authenticate themselves before submitting requests. Upon successful authentication, users can fill out the certificate request form with relevant details and submit their requests.
